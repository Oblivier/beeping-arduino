Bluetooth control beeping Arduino
This is the most basic explanation of how an arduino-uno works with bluetooth module which can enable us to operate devices remotely.
as shown in this experiment that we can switch on and off an alarm using our smart phone, we can implement advanced programming and devices to to more.

 Requirements:-
 1.Arduino uno
 2.male-male and male-female Jumper wires
 3.HC-05 Bluetooth module
 4.Beeper(Alarm)
 
 circuit diagram:-
 HC-05 module
 --connect 5v or vcc of module to 5v of arduino
 --connect GND of module to GND of arduino
 --connect TX of module to RX of arduino
 --connect RX of module to TX of arduino
 
 Beeper
 --connect positive of module to pin 8(defined pin) of arduino
 --connect negative of module to GND(digital) of arduino
